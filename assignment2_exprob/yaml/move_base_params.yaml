# Determines whether or not to shutdown the costmaps of the node when
# move_base is in an inactive state
# Move Base Node Parameters
shutdown_costmaps: true  # Shutdown costmaps flag
# The rate in Hz at which to run the control loop and send velocity
# commands to the base.
controller_frequency: 15.0  # Controller frequency
# How long the controller will wait in seconds without receiving a
# valid control before space-clearing operations are performed.
controller_patience: 15.0  # Controller patience

# The rate in Hz at which to run the global planning loop. If the
# frequency is set to 0.0, the global planner will only run when a new
# goal is received or the local planner reports that its path is
# blocked.
planner_frequency: 15.0  # Planner frequency
# How long the planner will wait in seconds in an attempt to find a
# valid plan before space-clearing operations are performed.
planner_patience: 15.0  # Planner patience
# How long in seconds to allow for oscillation before executing
# recovery behaviors. A value of 0.0 corresponds to an infinite
# timeout.
oscillation_timeout: 12.0  # Oscillation timeout
# How far in meters the robot must move to be considered not to be
# oscillating. Moving this far resets the timer counting up to the
# ~oscillation_timeout
oscillation_distance: 0.06  # Oscillation distance
# global planner
# The name of the plugin for the global planner to use with move_base.
# This plugin must adhere to the nav_core::BaseGlobalPlanner interface
# specified in the nav_core package.
