# Common Costmap Parameters
max_obstacle_height: 0.8  # Maximum obstacle height
obstacle_range: 4.0  # Obstacle range distance
# Obstacle Cost Shaping (http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d/hydro/inflation)
# distance a circular robot should be clear of the obstacle

raytrace_range: 4.0  # Raytracing range
robot_radius: 0.09  # Robot's radius
# if the robot is not circular
# footprint: [[x0, y0], [x1, y1], ... [xn, yn]] 
# max. distance from an obstacle at which costs are incurred for
# planning paths.

# exponential rate at which the obstacle cost drops off (default: 10)
# Voxel Map Configuration

# Observation Sources
observation_sources: laser  # Laser observation source

# Laser Configuration
laser:
